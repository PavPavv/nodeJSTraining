# NodeJS Global Mentoring Program [2021Q3 RU:PR3]
Mentee: **Pavel Durnov**

### Module 1: Help module (done)

### Module 2: Basics. Node.js fundamental theory (done)
**Comment**: 
1. In order to test this module clone the repository with **git clone** command in the terminal (if you are using HTTPS connection the path would be 'https://github.com/PavPavv/nodeJSTraining.git').
2. Open project in your code editor.
3. Open terminal in the root directory of the cloned project and follow next steps in the terminal.
4. Install _nodemon_ package with **npm i nodemon --save-dev**.
5. **_See_** all the branches from the server with **git branch -a** command.
6. In order to get and test first task type command in the terminal  **git checkout task1-1** and run the script with the following command in the terminal: **npm run task1**. Then program starts **_in the terminal!_**
7. In order to get and test second task exit the running program with **ctrl+C** and type command in the terminal  **git checkout task1-2**. Install local **_scvtojson_** dependency with **npm i csvtojson**. Then run the script with the following command in the terminal: **npm run task2**. Program will create text file _file.txt_ in the **src** directory.
8. In order to get and test the last task of this module exit the running program with **ctrl+C** and type command in the terminal  **git checkout task1-3**. Install local **_scvtojson_** dependencies with **npm i @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env**. Then run the script with the following command in the terminal: **npm run task3**. Program will create text file _file.txt_ in the **src** directory.

P.S. Sorry for inconveniences with the branches and the local npm packages, I've not decided yet with homework repo format, so I factorize every step in order to check everything in the beginning. If you are have a better approach I am open to suggestions. But anyway I am going to try to find more straightforward way to organize my homework starting from the next module.

### Module 3: In-memory CRUD REST service with validation (in progress...)
